This is a website i've designed and developed 2 years ago for a curtain manufacturer based in Dublin.
it is basically written in plain html/css/js with no CMS and essentially everything is hardcoded. 
The client didn't express the need for the website to have a CMS at the time and within 2 years it is still not realle relevant for the client therfor nothing has been changed during this time.
